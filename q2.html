        <h1>How the Action attribute works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p>The action attribute is a tag that is used in the creation of forms in HTML. It identifies the script or server would process any data that is collected from a submitted form.</p>
        <p>For example, the action attribute could be applied to a file called contacts.html, when a user enters in a phone number or email address. It would perform a lookup on for a match for that query within the contacts.html page.</p>
