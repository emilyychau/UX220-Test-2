        <h1>How the Action Attribute Works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p>The action attribute is a tag used the creation of forms in HTML. 
        It specifies the script or server-side program that should process any data that is collected from a submitted form, i.e. where it should go.
        Broadly, there are two places that data could go: externally to another website or internally to a file within the website.</p>
        <p>For example, the action attribute could be applied when creating a form on a page called home.html, 
        all the inputs collected from the contact information field would be directed into an internally housed contacts.html page.</p>
